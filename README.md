 1.The main objective of this project is to provide a complete automated Library by digitizing its
  each and every functionality. Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine
  generation, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single
  project. The project will be a web based project with a database server responsible for
  maintaining every single detail of the Library. It has a very user friendly interface which can
  easily be operated by any non-technical person.

      There are essentially two modules of this software;
 
  1.Admin module: Admin will have complete control over the system. Admin has permissions to
